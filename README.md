# Life-Expectancy-Prediction-using-Linear-Regression

This project contains use of Machine Learning Algorithm called Linear Regression. <br>
We have used the dataset <a href="https://github.com/starrylight90/Life-Expectancy-Prediction-using-Linear-Regression/blob/main/Life_Expectancy_Data.csv">Life_Expectancy_Data.csv </a>to predict the life expectancy. There are various parameters and based on those parameters we have trained the model. 
I have performed various tasks to improve my command on python as well. <br>
<b> Steps to perform Linear Regression: <br> </b>
1. Import the required libraries <br>
2. Import the dataset into a dataframe (df) <br>
3. Find out the empty columns <br>
4. Performed One-Hot Encoding <br>
5. Filled the empty columns using mean values <br>
6. Created Testing and Training Dataset <br>
7. I used 20% for testing and 80% for training <br>
8. From sklearn use <b> Linear Regression </b> <br>
9. Use .predict() to predict the Life Expectancy <br>
10. Show to predictions via graph <br>
11. Print the accuracy of the model via accuracy and score <br>
12. Check the RMSE, RAME, R2_score, etc <br>
13. Successful Completion of the Code <br>
 <b> Thankyou </b>
